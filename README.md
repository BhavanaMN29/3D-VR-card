# 3D-VR-card
This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive 3D virtual reality (VR) card using HTML, CSS (SCSS), and JavaScript. The card features a 3D flip animation effect that mimics the look and feel of a virtual card turning or flipping in a 3D space, which can be used for presenting various types of content such as images, text, or interactive features.
